# Alemeno Course Page

## Overview

Welcome to the Alemeno Course Page project! This project is a React-based web application that leverages React-Redux toolkit and Bootstrap 5 for front-end optimization. This website is fully responsive. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing educational platform.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Install Node Modules:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This command will start the development server, and you can view the website by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

3. **Install React-spinner:**

    ```bash
    npm install react-spinners
    ```

    This step is necessary to ensure the proper functionality of the loading spinner component used in the project.

## API Used

The project fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos). This API provides placeholder data for thumbnails and course titles, which is utilized to simulate dynamic content on the course page.

## Course Details

The course details page uses a sample course model that has been replicated for three courses. Due to the dynamic nature of the data, only placeholder information has been provided. For a more realistic representation, it is recommended to replace the sample data with actual course details.
